# Beamer-Template
USN template for presentations made using the package Beamer with pdfLaTeX

As a minimum, copy the files beamerthemeusn.sty and usnlogo.pdf to
the directory where you work on your presentation. As an alternative,
install them at the common place appropriate for such files on your system.
